> Even the most powerful wizard must consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness.

Welcome to Grimoire: community documentation of [clojure](http://clojure.org)!

Grimoire is still a work in progress, but features full documentation
of Clojure 1.4.X and newer available via the sidebar. This page
especially is in a state of flux as we try to figure out what the most
used documentation in Clojure is and what the nicest workflow to
access it quickly is.

Grimoire is free and open source hosted on the github link at the
sidebar. If you find typos or have suggestions to make feel free to
contact us either via the github link.
