Grimoire was hacked in 24hrs by [Reid McKenzie](http://arrdem.com/)
and [César Bolaños](https://github.com/cesarbp), and serves to provide
web documentation of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) language with
community contributed commentary and examples.

Since then, Grimoire has continued to evolve and now features examples
sourced from [clojuredocs](http://clojuredocs.org) as well as other
user submitted content.

Check out the github repository linked in the sidebar for more
information as well as the state of the project and work in progress
changes.
